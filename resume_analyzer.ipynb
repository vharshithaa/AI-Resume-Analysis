      "**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement / Suggested Skills:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Depth in SQL:** While listed, the projects don't explicitly showcase complex SQL queries (e.g., advanced joins, subqueries, window functions, CTEs, stored procedures, database optimization). For a Data Analyst, deep SQL is critical for data extraction and transformation.\n",
      "2.  **Statistical Foundations:** There's no explicit mention of statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, or A/B testing in the projects. Understanding statistical significance is paramount for drawing valid conclusions from data.\n",
      "3.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** While implied, explicitly detailing the challenges faced and solutions implemented during data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats) would strengthen the data analysis aspect.\n",
      "4.  **Advanced Data Visualization & Dashboarding:** While Power BI is listed, showcasing a detailed project involving interactive dashboards, key performance indicators (KPIs), and storytelling through data would be highly beneficial. Explore Tableau as well.\n",
      "5.  **Version Control (Git/GitHub):** This is a fundamental skill for collaborative development and managing code, and it's currently missing from the \"Tools & Technologies\" section.\n",
      "6.  **Cloud Platforms:** Exposure to cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) for data storage, warehousing (e.g., S3, Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake), and basic ETL processes is increasingly valued.\n",
      "7.  **Impact and Business Context:** Projects describe *what* was done but could benefit from explicitly stating the *insights* gained and their potential *business impact* or *real-world application* (e.g., \"This analysis helps in understanding public opinion on trending topics in real time, enabling businesses to quickly adapt marketing strategies or address customer concerns.\").\n",
      "8.  **Project Documentation/READMEs:** Ensure the provided \"code\" links lead to well-documented repositories (e.g., GitHub with clear READMEs explaining methodology, results, and insights).\n",
